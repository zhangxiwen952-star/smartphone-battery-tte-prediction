# Navigating the Power Dynamics: A Continuous-Time Equivalent Circuit Model for Smartphone Battery Prognostics and Management

This repository contains the implementation of a continuous-time model for predicting the **Time-to-Empty (TTE)** of smartphone batteries based on real-world usage and environmental conditions. The model integrates **equivalent circuit models (ECM)** and **energy balance equations** to estimate battery state-of-charge (SOC) and predict its remaining runtime.
